Upon running the script, the user can choose to either set a timer, or an alarm.
If the user chooses to set a timer, they will be asked to input the duration of the timer. After that duration has passed, a random alarm sound will be played.
If the user chooses to set an alarm, they will be asked to input the time and a random alarm sound will be played at that time.
The reason for keeping the alarm sound to be played random was to make sure that the user doesn't get used to the sound, which would defeat the purpose of an alarm.
Once the alarm/timer has been set, the screen will display and constantly update the amount of time left for the alarm/timer to go off. Like a countdown timer of sorts.
